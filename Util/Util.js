// User A will see that now there are 9 phones available.
//However another User B who has not put any phone in his cart

//initially did it this way, but now decided not to show the user
//the inventory_count and instead use "in_stock" flag, as this
//method is unneccessarily slow as it involves copying the 
//whole Products table.
